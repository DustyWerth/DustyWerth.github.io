This tool was developed as both an internal tool and an external tool. The external version of the tool is available <a href =https://ens-rapid-prod.azurewebsites.net/Login>Here </a> and is meant as buisness development tool to help capture early project information. This tool allows the end user to rank approximatley 30 different constraints that are important to the siting of various energy facilities and the tool will generate a conceptual constraint map as well as possible corridors for linear infrastructure.

This tool represents the first step towards a full AI Generative routing study.  I believe these generative tools will be a game changer not only in the competitive energy sectors (Renewables development, FERC 1000, etc.) but also in the traditional energy sectors.
