<font size="6"><br><strong>Detailed Project Description:</strong></font><font size="1"><br></font>
The Wolf Creek to Blackberry transmission line project, undertaken by NextEra Energy Transmission Southwest (NEET Southwest), is a pivotal initiative designed to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the electric grid. Spanning approximately 92 miles from Coffey County, Kansas, to Jasper County, Missouri, this 345 kV line aims to address congestion, offer market efficiencies, and deliver significant benefits to ratepayers as part of the 2019 Integrated Transmission Plan approved by the Southwest Power Pool. Set to be in service by early 2025, the project underscores a commitment to advanced technology and stakeholder engagement to improve grid performanceâ€‹.
<br>
In the development of the Wolf Creek to Blackberry transmission line project, a significant initiative aimed at enhancing grid reliability and efficiency, I played a multifaceted and crucial role. As the principal investigator and assistant project manager, I spearheaded research efforts and supported the overall management of the project, ensuring that all phases progressed smoothly and in alignment with our objectives.
<br>
My responsibilities delved into the technical domain, handling all Geographic Information System (GIS) data crucial for precise planning and analysis. This facilitated effective visualization and geographical information assessment. During the routing phase, I led efforts to gather key data, informing routing decisions and refining the project's design and environmental considerations. Additionally, I developed several ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Dashboards, ensuring the project team always had the most current project information at their fingertips, markedly boosting project efficiency and engagement.
<br>
I also contributed significantly to the regulatory aspect of the project by assisting with the development of the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) 1000 application. This involved compiling and presenting comprehensive information to demonstrate the project's compliance with regulatory standards and its benefits to the grid and consumers.
<br>
Beyond the technical and regulatory contributions, I played an active role in the project's legal and public relations efforts. I provided pre-filed direct testimony in both Missouri and Kansas, articulating the project's merits and addressing concerns. My involvement culminated in live testimony before the Kansas Corporation Commission, where I defended the project's route selection.
<br>
Engagement with the community and stakeholders was another critical aspect of my role. I participated in the public involvement program and individual stakeholder meetings, facilitating open dialogue, addressing questions and concerns, and building support for the project. This engagement was essential in ensuring transparency, fostering trust, and securing the necessary buy-in from affected communities and entities.
<br>
Overall, my involvement with the Wolf Creek to Blackberry transmission line project was comprehensive, spanning technical management, regulatory compliance, legal testimony, and public engagement. My contributions were instrumental in advancing the project towards its goals of enhancing grid reliability and efficiency, ultimately benefiting a wide range of stakeholders across the regions it serves.
