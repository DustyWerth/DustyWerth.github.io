In the dynamic landscape of the energy sector and beyond, project teams are perpetually faced with the challenge of determining allowable structure heights to avoid FAA Obstruction classifications. Leveraging the latest FAA data, I developed an innovative tool that models airspace protection surfaces, ensuring project teams have continuous access to critical updates every 28 days. This tool, crafted using FME Flow, automates the generation of Part 77 surfaces for every airport listed in the FAA's comprehensive database, guaranteeing the most current data is always at our team's fingertips.

To further enhance project planning and safety, additional functionalities were integrated to model TERPS (Terminal Instrument Procedures) alongside Part 77 surfaces. By constructing these surfaces in a 3D environment, we are able to precisely calculate the maximum allowable height for structures. This pivotal information aids in either circumventing the necessity to file with the FAA or ensuring compliance with obstruction standards, thereby minimizing the risk of mandatory structure marking and lighting.

The tool's precision and utility can be exponentially increased through the incorporation of high-accuracy ground surveys, such as LiDAR scans. This advanced approach not only refines the accuracy of our models but also solidifies our commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to meet the evolving needs of our projects and clients. Through these innovations, we are setting new standards in project safety and efficiency, ensuring our teams are equipped with the necessary tools to navigate the complexities of airspace regulations seamlessly.
