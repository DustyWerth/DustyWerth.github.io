<font size="6"><br><strong>Detailed Project Description:</strong></font><font size="1"><br></font>
The evolution of the Envolve application into a leading stakeholder database management system marks a pivotal advancement in how we manage and track our engagement with stakeholders. Taking over as the technical owner after its initial development phase, I was tasked with the critical role of steering Envolve through its next stages of enhancement and integration, ensuring its alignment with our organization's evolving needs.<br>
<br>
Envolve was conceived to streamline the stakeholder engagement process, providing a comprehensive platform capable of managing extensive data sets, facilitating seamless communication, and enabling detailed tracking of stakeholder interactions. As the system’s technical owner, my focus was on enhancing its functionality, scalability, and user experience to support both internal and external project demands more effectively.<br>
<br>
A significant part of my role involved optimizing the application’s infrastructure for increased adaptability and performance. This included the development of data models for reporting via Power BI, a task that proved challenging due to the original database schema developed by the initial software developer. Overcoming these obstacles required a deep dive into the existing database structure and a comprehensive overhaul to ensure the data models were not only accurate but also optimized for performance within Power BI. This endeavor was crucial for providing meaningful insights and analytics to our stakeholders, enhancing the decision-making process across our projects.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the backend infrastructure of Envolve underwent a significant overhaul to increase security and scalability. This revamp was pivotal in bringing all three environments—development, testing, and production—into parity, ensuring consistency and reliability across our deployment processes. The alignment of these environments facilitated a smoother development workflow and enabled our team to implement new features and updates with greater efficiency and less risk to the system's integrity.<br>
<br>
Employing an agile methodology, I led the development team in a flexible and responsive manner, adapting to new requirements and feedback to refine and expand the application’s features. This approach was essential in fostering a dynamic development environment where continuous improvement was not just a goal but a standard practice, ensuring that Envolve would exceed its initial objectives and offer robust support to our stakeholder management processes.  As part of this process I conducted investigation meetings with stakeholders to collect informaiton on new product features and converted those into user stories.  I also completed sprint planning sessions with the developers to outline the goals for the sprint and ensure that resources were aware of the requested outcomes.  Additionally I planned and executed weekly stand-ups between the product owners and the development team to review the progress of the sprint.<br>
<br>
In taking on the role of technical owner post-initial development, my focus was not only on technological enhancements but also on ensuring that Envolve remained a user-centric application. The aim was to provide our team with a powerful resource that simplifies the complexities of stakeholder management, thereby enabling better decision-making and fostering more meaningful engagements with our stakeholders.<br>
<br>
In enhancing the Envolve system, I leveraged Microsoft SQL Management Studio, Power BI, FME Flow, and FME Form to create sophisticated custom data models and reporting mechanisms. This initiative allowed for the generation of dynamic, insightful reports directly within Power BI, alongside custom email reports designed to keep project members and clients informed with the latest data insights. This reporting solution not only improved the decision-making process but also significantly increased the efficiency and effectiveness of our stakeholder engagement strategies, showcasing our capability to adapt and innovate in data management and analysis.<br>
<br>
In summary, the stewardship of the Envolve application under my technical leadership underscores a commitment to leveraging advanced technology for effective stakeholder engagement. Through strategic enhancements and continuous improvement, Envolve has become an indispensable application in our project management toolkit, setting new standards for efficiency, reliability, and user experience in stakeholder database management.<br>
