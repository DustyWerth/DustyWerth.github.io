<font size="6"><br><strong>Detailed Project Description:</strong></font><font size="1"><br></font>
On the Columbia County Transmission Project by New York State Electric & Gas Corporation (NYSEG), I held a crucial role that significantly contributed to enhancing the electrical infrastructure within Columbia County, New York. The project involved creating an 11.1-mile new 115-kilovolt (kV) transmission line, constructing a new switching station in Ghent, and making upgrades to an existing substation in Chatham, aimed at improving the grid's reliability, efficiency, and environmental compatibility.<br>
<br>
My leadership in environmental strategy was key to navigating the project through its critical phases, including routing the transmission line and deciding on the substation site. I managed comprehensive environmental assessments to ensure our decisions were environmentally sound and compliant with regulatory standards, identifying a project path that balanced technical needs with ecological considerations.<br>
<br>
I also took charge of acquiring high-resolution geospatial data by initiating a Request for Proposals (RFP) for custom aerial imagery and LiDAR services. This effort was vital for obtaining detailed spatial data to support route planning and environmental evaluations. Managing Geographic Information System (GIS) data, I made sure that accurate and up-to-date information was accessible to all stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making and enhancing project efficiency.<br>
<br>
In addition, I was responsible for managing public involvement activities, which included organizing outreach, public meetings, and engaging with stakeholders to ensure transparency and collaboration. This engagement was crucial for addressing community concerns and building support for the project. My role also extended to the regulatory domain, where I prepared and filed pre-filed direct testimony in support of the projectâ€™s route, and provided live testimony before regulatory commissions, advocating for project approval by highlighting our commitment to environmental stewardship and technical excellence.<br>
<br>
In summary, my work on the Columbia County Transmission Project covered environmental management, technical procurement, GIS data oversight, community engagement, and regulatory advocacy. My efforts were instrumental in advancing the project towards its goals of enhancing grid reliability and efficiency, setting a standard for future infrastructure projects in terms of sustainability, accuracy, and community partnership.<br>
