Over the span of more than a decade, my role in the Southern Spirit Project has been multifaceted and critical to its success. As the main GIS user, I was responsible for managing an extensive array of geospatial data that was crucial for the project's development. This included sourcing data from federal levels, three different states, and multiple third-party vendors, which required substantial coordination and integration efforts. The lack of digital records in certain areas necessitated large-scale digitization efforts, underscoring the project's complexity and the depth of my involvement.

Furthermore, I maintained a Spatial Database Engine (SDE) database, ensuring the integrity and accessibility of the project's geospatial data. This role was integral to the project's logistics and planning phases, providing a reliable foundation for decision-making processes.

In addition to my technical responsibilities, I also took on a leadership role as the assistant project manager, where I was instrumental in managing large teams. My duties extended to leading the project's routing specialist team, guiding the project from initial feasibility studies through to the selection of the final route. This process was not only technical in nature but also required careful consideration of public input, demonstrated through an extensive public involvement program that featured several weeks of in-person meetings.

The Southern Spirit Project stands as a testament to my comprehensive skill set, blending technical expertise in GIS and project management with a deep commitment to community engagement and stakeholder management. Through my contributions, the project has navigated the challenges of integrating vast datasets, managing large teams, and making critical infrastructural decisions that will have long-lasting benefits for the region.
