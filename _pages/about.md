Hello! I'm Dusty, with a rich career spanning over 17 years in GIS and environmental consulting. My professional days are filled with process mapping, developing innovative tools, and leading dedicated teams through complex projects. My journey is underpinned by deep technical knowledge across data analysis, data visualization, cloud platforms, and application development. This blend of skills has allowed me to drive significant improvements in quality, efficiency, innovation, and training.

Beyond my professional life, I'm deeply passionate about exploring the world and its myriad cultures. Traveling is more than a hobbyâ€”it's a way of life that opens my mind to new perspectives and inspires my every endeavor. Whether it's the vibrant life in a foreign city or the serene beauty of a secluded spot, each destination offers new lessons, fresh challenges, and the chance to connect with diverse people.

When not exploring, I'm often found behind the grill or the smoker, indulging in my love for cooking. As a seasoned competitor on the BBQ competition circuit, I've earned numerous awards for my culinary skills. Cooking, especially BBQ, allows me to blend art and science, creating delicious experiences for friends and family.

Gardening offers me a peaceful escape, a connection to the earth that's both creative and nurturing. My garden is a source of joy and fulfillment, a testament to the beauty that comes from care and patience. At home, life is further enriched by my husband of 9 years and our three dogs, providing a foundation of love, laughter, and the occasional bark.

I come from a large family where gatherings with my brothers, their dogs, and my nieces and nephews are cherished. These moments remind me of the invaluable support and grounding that only family can provide.

Nature calls to me, offering both solace and adventure. Hiking, camping, and simply being in the great outdoors are essential to my well-being, reminding me of the planet's beauty and our responsibility to protect it.
